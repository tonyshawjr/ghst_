# CLAUDE.md - Vibe Code Development System
**Do not edit the root CLAUD.md file**

## üöÄ QUICK START PROTOCOL

When Tony says any of these phrases:
- "Let's get to work"
- "Let's build"
- "Time to code"
- "Continue from last session"

**AUTOMATICALLY DO THIS:**
```
1. Run: /mcp__serena__initial_instructions
2. Run: /mcp__barry__initial_instructions  
3. Ask Serena: "read memory current-work-state"
4. Ask Barry: "read memory session-handoff"
5. Say: "Ready to work! Here's where we left off: [summary]"
```

## üìÇ FOLDER-SPECIFIC CLAUDE.md PROTOCOL

**EVERY folder created in the project MUST have its own CLAUDE.md file that describes:**
1. Purpose of this folder
2. Specific rules for files in this folder
3. Patterns and conventions to follow
4. Which specialist agents typically work here

**When creating ANY new folder:**
1. Immediately create a CLAUDE.md inside it
2. Use Serena to populate it with folder-specific guidelines
3. Include relevant code patterns and examples

### Standard Folder Templates:

**For `src/components/CLAUDE.md`:**
```markdown
# Components Folder

## Purpose

- frontend-developer
- whimsy-injector
```

**For `src/api/CLAUDE.md`:**
```markdown
# API Folder

## Purpose
Backend API routes and endpoints

## Rules
- RESTful naming conventions
- Error handling on every endpoint
- Rate limiting for public routes

## Rules
- Pure functions only
- Comprehensive unit tests
- JSDoc with examples
- No side effects
- Export named functions

## Primary Agents
- rapid-prototyper
- test-writer-fixer
```

## üìÅ REQUIRED PROJECT FILES

**Every new project MUST have these files created immediately:**

### 1. CHANGELOG.md
```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - [Date]
### Added
- Initial project setup

### Phase 1: MVP (Current)
- [ ] [Task 1]
- [ ] [Task 2]

### Phase 2: Enhancement
- [ ] [Future feature]

## Success Metrics
- [What defines success]
```

## VERSION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

**After EVERY coding session:**
1. Update CHANGELOG.md with changes
2. Increment version:
   - Bug fixes: 0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.1.1
   - New features: 0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.2.0
   - Major changes: 0.1.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0
3. Update PLAN.md with completed tasks
4. Commit with message: "v[version]: [summary of changes]"

## AGENT ORCHESTRATION PROTOCOL

When working on tasks:
1. Identify which expertise is needed
2. Note available specialist agents:
   - "This needs frontend expertise, I'll use frontend-developer"
   - "We need to make this more fun, I'll consult whimsy-injector"
   - "For the backend API, I'll use backend-architect"
3. Pass full context to specialist agents
4. Integrate their work back into the project
5. Use Serena to implement the code changes
6. Use Barry to document decisions

## PROJECT INITIALIZATION WORKFLOW

When Tony provides a new PRD:
1. Ask: "What should we call this project?"
2. **CREATE REQUIRED FILES:**
   - README.md (with project description)
   - CHANGELOG.md (with v0.1.0 entry)
   - PLAN.md (with full PRD details)
   - CLAUDE.md in EVERY folder created
3. Analyze PRD to determine which agents will be needed
4. Use rapid-prototyper to create initial structure
5. Coordinate other agents as needed (ui-designer, backend-architect)
6. Build out the PRD implementation using Serena for all code operations
7. After initial build is complete:
   - Create initial commit: `git add . && git commit -m "v0.1.0: Initial build"`
   - Create GitHub repo: `git remote add origin https://github.com/tonyshawjr/[project-name]`
   - Push to main: `git push -u origin main`
8. Update CHANGELOG.md with all initial features
9. Use Barry to create memory "project-inception" with:
   - Project name and Tony's vision
   - Key architectural decisions
   - Tech stack choices
   - Initial PRD requirements
   - Feature ideas for Tony to consider
   - Which specialist agents were used

## AUTOMATIC CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

**Before starting work in ANY folder:**
1. Check if folder has CLAUDE.md - if not, create it
2. Read both root CLAUDE.md and folder-specific CLAUDE.md
3. Follow combined rules from both files

Before making any changes:
1. Ask Serena to read memory "current-work-state" 
2. Ask Barry for any relevant notes
3. Use Serena to list what files you're about to modify
4. Check if specialist agents are needed for the task

After making changes:
1. Use Serena to update memory "current-work-state" with:
   - Files modified
   - Functions changed
   - What still needs to be done
   - Any errors encountered
   - Which agents contributed
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with changes
3. Use Barry to note any business decisions or feature ideas

Before the conversation ends or gets long:
1. Use both Serena and Barry to create comprehensive handoffs
2. Document which specialist agents were involved
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with session summary
4. Say: "Progress saved! Next time just say 'let's get to work' to continue."

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

After initial repo creation:
- NO git operations (Tony handles all branching/pushing)
- Use Serena for all code navigation and editing
- Use Barry to track feature ideas and decisions
- Invoke specialist agents for domain-specific tasks
- When Tony suggests features, add them to Barry's notes
- Update CHANGELOG.md after every change
- Keep PLAN.md current with completed tasks

## MEMORY ALLOCATION

**Serena handles:**
- `current-work-state` - Active code changes
- `project-structure` - File organization
- `code-decisions` - Technical implementation details
- `agent-contributions` - Which agents worked on what
- CHANGELOG.md updates

**Barry handles:**
- `project-inception` - Original vision and PRD
- `features-backlog` - Tony's ideas to implement
- `session-handoff` - Complete context for next session
- `business-context` - Why decisions were made
- `agent-history` - Timeline of which agents were used
- PLAN.md updates

## PROJECT STATUS REPORTING

Always be ready to answer using both tools:
- "What have we built so far?" (Serena + Barry + CHANGELOG.md)
- "What's left to implement?" (Barry's feature list + PLAN.md)
- "What was the last thing we worked on?" (Serena's work state + CHANGELOG.md)
- "What files did we modify?" (Serena's tracking)
- "What was my original vision?" (Barry's project inception + PLAN.md)
- "Which agents have we used?" (Barry's agent history)
- "What version are we on?" (CHANGELOG.md)

- Automatically activates tools when Tony says "let's get to work"
- Orchestrates Serena, Barry, and all specialist agents to implement Tony's vision
- Only does git operations during initial project setup
- Maintains perfect context using both tools and across all agents
- Translates ideas into working code by coordinating the right experts
- Never loses track of anything or anyone's contributions
- Knows when to call in specialists vs. handle it yourself
- Ensures every agent's work integrates seamlessly
- Keeps CHANGELOG.md and PLAN.md always current

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

- **"Let's get to work" = Auto-activate everything**

- **Version numbers increment with every change**
- **No manual memory commands needed from Tony**
- Tony is the visionary - respect his ideas and direction
- Speed matters - use rapid-prototyper for quick MVPs
- Quality matters - use test-writer-fixer before considering anything "done"
- Delight matters - use whimsy-injector to make things memorable
- Growth matters - consider viral potential in every feature
- Memory matters - document EVERYTHING in Serena and Barry
