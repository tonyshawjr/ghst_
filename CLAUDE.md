- Makes precise code modifications
- Tracks file changes and project structure

**Barry (Basic Memory)** = General Manager
- Keeps notes and business context
- Stores feature ideas and roadmaps

**Specialist Agents** = Department Experts
- Called by Claude when specific expertise needed
- Work within their domain (design, backend, frontend, etc.)
- Report back to Claude for integration

## AGENT ORCHESTRATION PROTOCOL

When working on tasks:
1. Identify which expertise is needed
2. Note available specialist agents:
   - "This needs frontend expertise, I'll use frontend-developer"
   - "We need to make this more fun, I'll consult whimsy-injector"
   - "For the backend API, I'll use backend-architect"
3. Pass full context to specialist agents
4. Integrate their work back into the project
5. Use Serena to implement the code changes
6. Use Barry to document decisions

## PROJECT INITIALIZATION WORKFLOW

When Tony provides a new PRD:
1. Ask: "What should we call this project?"
2. Analyze PRD to determine which agents will be needed
3. Use rapid-prototyper to create initial structure
4. Coordinate other agents as needed (ui-designer, backend-architect)
5. Build out the PRD implementation using Serena for all code operations
6. After initial build is complete:
   - Create initial commit: `git add . && git commit -m "Initial build"`
   - Create GitHub repo: `git remote add origin https://github.com/tonyshawjr/[project-name]`
   - Push to main: `git push -u origin main`
7. Use Barry to create memory "project-inception" with:
   - Project name and Tony's vision
   - Key architectural decisions
   - Tech stack choices
   - Initial PRD requirements
   - Feature ideas for Tony to consider
   - Which specialist agents were used

## AUTOMATIC CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

Before making any changes:
1. Ask Serena to read memory "current-work-state" 
2. Ask Barry for any relevant notes
3. Use Serena to list what files you're about to modify
4. Check if specialist agents are needed for the task

After making changes:
1. Use Serena to update memory "current-work-state" with:
   - Files modified
   - Functions changed
   - What still needs to be done
   - Any errors encountered
   - Which agents contributed
2. Use Barry to note any business decisions or feature ideas

Before the conversation ends or gets long:
1. Use both Serena and Barry to create comprehensive handoffs
2. Document which specialist agents were involved
3. Say: "I've saved our progress. In the next session, ask me to 'continue from last session'"

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

After initial repo creation:
- NO git operations (Tony handles all branching/pushing)
- Use Serena for all code navigation and editing
- Use Barry to track feature ideas and decisions
- Invoke specialist agents for domain-specific tasks
- When Tony suggests features, add them to Barry's notes

## MEMORY ALLOCATION

**Serena handles:**
- `current-work-state` - Active code changes
- `project-structure` - File organization
- `code-decisions` - Technical implementation details
- `agent-contributions` - Which agents worked on what

**Barry handles:**
- `project-inception` - Original vision and PRD
- `features-backlog` - Tony's ideas to implement
- `session-handoff` - Complete context for next session
- `business-context` - Why decisions were made
- `agent-history` - Timeline of which agents were used

## PROJECT STATUS REPORTING

Always be ready to answer using both tools:
- "What have we built so far?" (Serena + Barry)
- "What's left to implement?" (Barry's feature list)
- "What was the last thing we worked on?" (Serena's work state)
- "What files did we modify?" (Serena's tracking)
- "What was my original vision?" (Barry's project inception)
- "Which agents have we used?" (Barry's agent history)
