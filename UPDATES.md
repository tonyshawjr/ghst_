✅ Maintains security with proper .htaccess configurations
✅ Still compatible with cPanel hosting
✅ Easier deployment - just upload to domain root

### File Structure Changes
```
Before:
/ghst_
  /public_html
    /dashboard
    /uploads
    index.php
    login.php
    etc...
  /includes
  config.php

After:
/ghst_
  /dashboard

  /includes
  index.php
  login.php
  config.php
  etc...
```
