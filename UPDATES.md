- Thumbnail extraction from videos
- Video information retrieval (duration, dimensions)
- Placeholder for future compression features

### Technical Implementation Details

#### New/Modified Files:
1. **includes/MediaProcessor.php** - Core media processing class
2. **api/media/convert.php** - Format conversion endpoint
3. **api/media/optimize.php** - Platform optimization endpoint
4. **dashboard/media.php** - Updated to show real thumbnails
5. **config.php** - Added MEDIA_PATH constant

#### Processing Capabilities:
- **GD Library**: Basic image operations, format conversion
- **ImageMagick**: Advanced image processing, better quality
- **FFmpeg**: Video thumbnail extraction, video info
- Graceful degradation when libraries unavailable

### Media Library Improvements
- Real thumbnail previews instead of colored placeholders
- Platform indicator showing optimized versions
- File size display with human-readable format
- Video files show extracted thumbnail with play icon
- Improved grid layout with better aspect ratios

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy thumbnail generation (on first request)
- Cached platform versions
- Memory-efficient image processing
- Progressive JPEG encoding
- Optimal compression levels

### Next Steps for Media Processing
1. Add batch processing for multiple files
2. Implement video compression (requires FFmpeg)
3. Add watermark functionality
4. Create image editor interface
5. Add EXIF data handling
6. Implement CDN integration
