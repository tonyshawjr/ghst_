   ```

3. **Configuration**

   - Update database credentials
   - For MAMP: Set DB_HOST to '127.0.0.1' and DB_PORT to 8889
   - Set your domain and paths
   - Configure OAuth credentials when ready
   - For development: session.cookie_secure = 0

4. **Cron Job Setup**

   */5 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/your/domain/cron.php

## OAuth Setup & Installation
- **Comprehensive 4-Step Installer** - database, admin account, OAuth, completion

- **Visual Setup Progress** - clear indicators for configured vs setup needed platforms
- **Developer Console Links** - direct access to platform developer pages
- **Automatic Menu Updates** - OAuth setup disappears when configuration complete
- **Complete Reset Feature** - safely wipe all data and restart installation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database connection failed**: 
   - Change DB_HOST to '127.0.0.1' instead of 'localhost' if needed
   - Check DB_PORT (usually 3306, 8889 for MAMP)

2. **Admin account creation failed**:
   - Ensure database schema uses `password_hash` column, not `password`
   - Run installer which handles proper column names

3. **Reset installation fails**:
   - Check for foreign key constraint errors
   - Use the built-in reset feature which handles table deletion order properly

4. **OAuth setup issues**:
   - Use the dedicated OAuth setup page (appears in menu when needed)
   - Verify redirect URLs match exactly with platform developer settings
   - Check that all three platforms (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) are configured

5. **Mobile login issues**:
   - Set `session.cookie_secure` to 0 for HTTP development
   - Use `session.cookie_samesite` = 'Lax' for cross-site compatibility

6. **Settings page issues**:
   - Client settings should only appear in Profile tab
   - OAuth setup should not be in settings (it has its own page)

7. **Upload errors**: Check file permissions (755 for uploads folder)

8. **Token expired**: Re-authenticate through OAuth setup page

## Mobile Testing

To test on mobile devices:
```bash
# Start server on all interfaces
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000

# Access from mobile device using computer's IP
http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8000
```
