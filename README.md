   mysql -u your_username -p your_database < db/schema.sql
   ```

3. **Configuration**
   - Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php`
   - Update database credentials
   - For MAMP: Set DB_HOST to '127.0.0.1' and DB_PORT to 8889
   - Set your domain and paths
   - Configure OAuth credentials when ready
   - For development: session.cookie_secure = 0

4. **Cron Job Setup**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database connection failed**: 
   - For MAMP: Change DB_HOST to '127.0.0.1' instead of 'localhost'
   - Check DB_PORT (usually 8889 for MAMP)

2. **Mobile login issues**:
   - Set `session.cookie_secure` to 0 for HTTP development
   - Use `session.cookie_samesite` = 'Lax' for cross-site compatibility

3. **Cron not running**: Check cPanel error logs

4. **OAuth failures**: Verify redirect URLs match

5. **Upload errors**: Check file permissions (755 for uploads folder)

6. **Token expired**: Re-authenticate in settings

## Mobile Testing

To test on mobile devices:
```bash
# Start server on all interfaces
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000

# Access from mobile device using computer's IP
http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8000
```
